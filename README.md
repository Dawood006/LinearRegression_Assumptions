# Linear Regression Assumptions: Before and After Analysis

This project focuses on understanding and validating the key assumptions of linear regression before and after fitting a model. By carefully examining these assumptions, we can ensure the reliability and interpretability of the regression results.

## Project Overview

The notebook provides a comprehensive workflow to:

1. **Validate Linear Regression Assumptions**:
    - **Linearity**: Checking whether the relationship between the independent and dependent variables is linear.
    - **Normality of Residuals**: Ensuring that residuals are approximately normally distributed.
    - **Homoscedasticity**: Verifying that the variance of residuals is constant across all levels of the independent variables.
    - **Independence of Residuals**: Confirming that residuals are independent of each other.

2. **Model Development**:
    - Fitting a linear regression model using the dataset.

3. **Post-Model Evaluation**:
    - Reassessing the assumptions after fitting the model to identify any violations or areas for improvement.

4. **Visual and Statistical Tools**:
    - Utilizes plots such as scatter plots, residual plots, histograms, and Q-Q plots.
    - Leverages statistical tests to validate assumptions.

## Files

- **`Linear_Assumption.ipynb`**: The main Jupyter Notebook containing all the code and analysis for this project.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- statsmodels
- scikit-learn

You can install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn statsmodels scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd <project_directory>
    ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Linear_Assumption.ipynb
    ```

4. Follow the cells step by step to explore the data, validate assumptions, and fit the linear regression model.

## Key Insights

- Proper validation of assumptions ensures the robustness of linear regression analysis.
- Visualizations and statistical tests complement each other in diagnosing potential issues.
- Understanding assumption violations can guide corrective actions, such as transformations or alternative modeling techniques.
